**Outcome Hierarchy**

**If multiple conflicting outcomes occur on the same day, the outcomes
for that service day will be reassigned based on the logic below.
However, the trimester codes will be preserved and unaffected.**

Acceptable Combinations:

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Twin

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Multiple

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Term/Postpartum

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Term/Postpartum/Twin

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Term/Postpartum/Multiple

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Post Term/Postpartum

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Post Term/Postpartum/Twin

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Post Term/Postpartum/Multiple

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Pre-Term

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Pre-Term/Twin

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Pre-Term/Twin/Postpartum

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Pre-Term/Multiple

-   Delivery/Live Birth/C-Section/Pre-Term/Multiple/Postpartum

-   Delivery/C-Section/Stillborn/Unclassified Pregnancy Loss & Twin

-   Delivery/C-Section/Stillborn/Unclassified Pregnancy Loss & Multiple

-   Delivery/C-Section/Stillborn/Unclassified Pregnancy Loss

-   Spontaneous Abortion/Unclassified Pregnancy Loss/Postpartum

-   Induced Abortion/Unclassified Pregnancy Loss/Postpartum

-   Stillborn/Unclassified Pregnancy Loss/Postpartum

-   Ectopic Pregnancy/Unclassified Pregnancy Loss/Postpartum

-   Pregnancy with any acceptable Outcome combination

1.  If outcome of "Twin Birth" and "Twin Birth\*", overwrite "Twin
    Birth\*", as "Twin Birth" for entire pregnancy

    If outcome of "Multiple Birth Unspecified" and "Multiple Birth
    Unspecified \*", overwrite "Multiple Birth Unspecified \*", as
    "Multiple Birth Unspecified" for entire pregnancy

    If outcome of "Multiple Birth" and "Multiple Birth\*", overwrite
    "Multiple Birth\*", as "Multiple Birth" for entire pregnancy

    If outcome of "Twin Birth\*" and "Multiple Birth Unspecified\*",
    overwrite "Multiple Birth Unspecified\*" as "Twin Birth\*" for
    entire pregnancy

    Any non-stars use non-star; when both stars, use stars

    If outcome of "Twin Birth\*" and "Multiple Birth Unspecified\*",
    overwrite "Multiple Birth Unspecified\*" as "Twin Birth\*" for
    entire pregnancy

    If outcome of "Multiple Birth" and "Multiple Birth Unspecified",
    overwrite "Multiple Birth Unspecified" as "Multiple Birth" for
    entire pregnancy

    If outcome of "Twin Birth" and "Multiple Birth", then classify as
    "Multiple Birth Unspecified" for entire pregnancy

    Entire pregnancy defined as 270 days

2.  Regardless of L&D Codes; if multiple losses occur within 60 days,
    apply hierarchy

    i.  Ectopic pregnancy
    ii. Spontaneous abortion
    iii. Induced abortion
    iv. Stillbirth
    v.  Unclassified pregnancy loss

3.  No multiples (within 180 days):

    Loss outcome within -30 days to +60 days of a Labor & Delivery Code

    Labor & Delivery outcome will be overwritten

    Spontaneous abortion & Labor & Delivery Codes = Spontaneous abortion

    Ectopic & Labor & Delivery Codes = Ectopic

    Induced abortion & Labor & Delivery Codes = Induced abortion

    Stillbirth abortion & Labor & Delivery Codes = Stillbirth

    \# Unclassified outcomes \>= \# Labor & Delivery Codes =
    Unclassified

    \# Unclassified \< \# Labor & Delivery Codes = Pregnancy\*

4.  No multiple pregnancy within 180 days:

    Labor & Delivery Codes within +60 days to +180 days of a Loss
    outcome

    Loss outcome will be overwritten

    Ectopic & more than 1 Labor & Delivery Codes = Pregnancy\*

    Spontaneous abortion & more than 1 Labor & Delivery Codes =
    Pregnancy\*

    Induced abortion & more than 1 Labor & Delivery Codes = Pregnancy\*

    Stillbirth abortion & more than 1 Labor & Delivery Codes =
    Pregnancy\*

    Unclassified & more than 1 Labor & Delivery Codes = Pregnancy\*

5.  If multiple Term outcomes occur within -60 days to +60 days of each
    other, apply the following hierarchy:

    a.  Pre-term
    b.  Term
    c.  Post-term
    d.  Post-term\*

"CAPS" refers to outcome classification grouping

**Classification of outcomes**
