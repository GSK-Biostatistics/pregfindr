## About

{pregfindr} is the open-source R implementation of an algorithm developed using two United States insurance claims databases to identify pregnancies, pregnancy outcomes including losses, trimesters and pregnancy length, based on diagnostic and procedure ontologies (ICD-9/10, CPT). The algorithm is described in Sumner, K. M., Ehlinger, A., Georgiou, M. E., & Wurst, K. E. (2021). Development and evaluation of standardized pregnancy identification and trimester distribution algorithms in U.S. IBM MarketScanÂ® Commercial and Medicaid data. Birth defects research, 113(19), 1357--1367. <https://doi.org/10.1002/bdr2.1954>

Data on medicine/vaccine safety is typically generated post launch. Post marketing safety studies are committed before understanding medicine/vaccine uptake and characteristics of exposed pregnant women resulting in sub-optimal study design with few robust data generated to guide prescribing for this vulnerable population.

Large real-world healthcare datasets and rapid analytic query tools offer an opportunity to identify key areas of public health concern and optimise study approaches to ensure benefit risk data generation for this population under-served by clinical research.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {pregfindr} like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("GSK-Biostatistics/pregfindr")
```

## Use
